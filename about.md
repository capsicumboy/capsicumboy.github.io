I am just a guy who loves chili – both to grow and eat. I want to inspire others to dare to discover chili peppers full potential in cooking, not only in traditional dishes, but also in desserts, candy m.m. I also want to inspire you to dare to grow your own chili. You don't need a big garden with a place for the greenhouse – I have an apartment with a balcony and it'll do just fine!
