### Instructions
Start by wash your chili peppers and tomatoes. 
Now it's time to scald the tomatoes in hot water. This makes it easier to peel them. When you have removed the peel you should remove the tomatoe seeds. 
Cut the tomatoes into pieces. Now it's time to peel, remove the apple core and dice the apple. Dice and peel the garlic and onions. 

Add everything in a pot together with water and let it simmer under a lid for about 15 minutes. 

Pour the mixture into a blender and run until everything is finely divided, or pass through a fine mesh strainer. Pour the sauce mix back into the pot and add the remaining ingredients. 

Simmer, stirring occasionally for 5 minutes. Pour in hot, well-cleaned bottles or cans. Seal. Let stand in the fridge for a couple of weeks to mature before it is eaten.
