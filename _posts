Hey and welcome to my blog! I'll start with a great tip on how to use your homegrown chili peppers! I really hope you enjoy it and I think it's a bit special in that sense that I haven't seen that many recipes using chili like this!

This chili syrup is very simple and very good.It is very tasty to drizzle on fresh berries (like strawberries, raspberries or blueberries), ice cream -or why not on the apple slices in your delicious apple pie!

I made the syrup using one of my favorite chili peppers, namely the fiery Carolina Reaper, belonging to the category of really hot chili peppers. I mean it! It is SUPER HOT! The reaper have an incredibly good flavour, both in smell and taste, and that's what I like this pepper. Oh, you know what? Growing carolina reaper is also easy to do in your apartment and it provides plenty of fruit. But of course you make chili syrup your favorite chili. If you don't grow chili for yourself, I recommend that you use regular red Habanero which is available to buy in almost every grocery store. Sugar suppresses namely, the heat of the chili pepper, the hefty and if you would use milder chili varieties such as Jalapeño or red peppers, I suspect that the heat would disappear altogether. Despite using a really hot chili the chili syrup ended up with a mild heat. Yes, also ”normal” people will be able to eat it! Not just chili nerds and daredevils!  But it all comes down to the amount of chili you use, of course!

## Ingredients 

* 1 cup white syrup

* 5 g of Carolina Reaper, or your favorite chili of stronger variety. Customize the weight to what strength you want to achieve. (For instance, use about 20-25g if you use Habanero.)

## Instructions

1. Pour the syrup in a glass jar.
2. Slice the chili peppers in half on the length (they should not seeded). Put them cut surface down in the syrup. 
3. Press them down under the surface as best you can.
4. Let the jar stand in the window for 4-6 weeks.
5. Remove the fruits and pour over the syrup in a nice bottle or jar.

The chili peppers you can of course use something else in the way of food. To throw chlli which is not poor is almost a crime...

That was it! Really simple! I hope you enjoyed it and have found a new way to use your homegrown chili peppers!

Take care!
