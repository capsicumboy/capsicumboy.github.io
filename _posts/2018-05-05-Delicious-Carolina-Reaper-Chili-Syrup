Here's a tip on something that is very simple and very good – chilisirap.It is very tasty to drizzle on fresh berries (t.ex. strawberries, raspberries or blueberries), ice cream-or why not on the äpplebitarna in äpplepajen!
Furthermore, it is as simple as to make a good chilisirap – it takes care of itself, namely all by yourself!

My chilisirap I did on one of my favoritchilisorter, namely the Bhut Jolokia, belonging to the category of really hot chilisar. Jolokian have an incredibly good blommighet, both in smell and taste, and therefore I like it. (It is also easy to grow in the apartment and provides plenty of fruit.) But of course you can do chilisirap on the chilli you want. If you don't grow chili for yourself, I recommend that you use regular red Habanero which is available to buy in almost every grocery store. Sugar suppresses namely, the heat of the chili pepper, the hefty and if you would use milder chilisorter such as Jalapeño or hot pepper, I suspect that the heat would disappear altogether. Despite a really hot chilli got my chilisirap a moderate heat, as also ”normal” people can eat, not just chilinördar.  But it depends of course on the amount of chili you use, too, of course!

1 cup white syrup
5 g of Bhut Jolokia, or other optional chili. Customize the weight to what strength you want to achieve. (Take about 20-25g if you use Habanero.)
Pour the syrup in a glass jar.
Cut chilifrukterna in half on the length (they should not seeded) and add with the cut surface down in the syrup. Press them down under the surface as best you can.
Let the jar stand in the window for 4-6 weeks.
Take away the fruits and pour over the syrup in a nice bottle or jar.
The halvskrumpna chilifrukterna you can of course use something else in the way of food. To throw chlli which is not poor is almost a crime...
