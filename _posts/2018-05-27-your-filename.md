Hey again! I recently posted my [simple chili pepper recipe](https://capsicumboy.github.io/A-Simple-Chili-Sauce-Recipe/) and I am back again with some inspiration on what to do when your homegrown chili peppers have ripen. Chili sauce is awesome in so many ways. Here's a recipe from Jamie Oliver. Enjoy!
